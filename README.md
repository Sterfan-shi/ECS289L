# ECS289L

## Work Breakdown
Dakai Kang:
1. Write the script for fetching weather and soil data for each latitude-longitude cell
2. Write the script to integrate the model prediction results for future years
3. Fetching weather data for years from 1981 to 2010 as the basis for generating future weather.
4. run models to predict crop yield for every geo-cell, each crop, every 30 years, using RCP4.5 Weather.

Zizhong Li:
1. Research how the APSIMX models work, tuning parameters for prediction.
2. Run models to produce the crop yield for 20 geo-cells for past years, under different input levels, fertilizer, etc.
3. Write the script to integrate model results, and use Tableau to generate diagrams.
4. Draw Tableau diagrams for future yield.

Zaoyi Zheng:
1. Break down the project and organize the teamwork.
2. Finding a place that meets the requirements for Project 2, fetching crop information and yield data.
3. Run models to produce the crop yield for 20 geo-cells for past years, under different input levels, fertilizer, etc.
4. Integrate all outcomes and prepare for the presentation.

Yifeng Shi:
1. Choose RCP4.5 and 8.5, fetch the corresponding weather data projection file, and analyze data for each geo-cell for 2011-2040,2041-2070,2071-2100
2. Use weather data for 1981-2010 as the base, producing weather data for each day of every 30 years.
3. Fetching Future potential yield data corresponding to RCP4.5 and RCP8.5  
4. run models to predict crop yield for every geo-cell, each crop, every 30 years, using RCP8.5 Weather.
